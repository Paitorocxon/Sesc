##  Installing Sesc
You do NOT need any extra libs.
Everything is in here.
 1. Download Sesc
 2. put "sesc.php" and "sesclib/" into your webfolder (e.g: "/var/www/html" for apache2)
 3. Change the loginsettings (not the final login-module/secure one is comming soon!)
    Open "sesclib/modules/main.login.php" and edit the password and username on line 71.
 4. Open the browser of your choice and goto (he! he!) "http://localhost/sesc.php"
    If you see the Sesc-Loginwindow everything is fine.
    
    
## Troubleshooting
Error, security gaps or wished to paiorocxon@gmail.com

## Future of Sesc
+ Directory traveling
+ sqlbased Login and user preveleges
+ Better main.search.php module (i'll try to make it faster)
+ Better performance
- Temporary loginprocess (unsecure af)
